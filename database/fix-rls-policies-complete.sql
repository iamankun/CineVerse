-- ========================================
-- FIX RLS POLICES CHO PROFILES VA STORAGE
-- ========================================

-- 1. Enable RLS trên profiles table
ALTER TABLE profiles ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- 2. Drop existing policies (nếu có)
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view their own profile" ON profiles;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can insert their own profile" ON profiles;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can update their own profile" ON profiles;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can delete their own profile" ON profiles;

-- 3. Create RLS policies cho profiles
CREATE POLICY "Users can view their own profile" ON profiles
  FOR SELECT USING (auth.uid() = id);

CREATE POLICY "Users can insert their own profile" ON profiles
  FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = id);

CREATE POLICY "Users can update their own profile" ON profiles
  FOR UPDATE USING (auth.uid() = id);

CREATE POLICY "Users can delete their own profile" ON profiles
  FOR DELETE USING (auth.uid() = id);

-- 4. Drop existing storage policies (nếu có)
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can upload their own avatar" ON storage.objects;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view their own avatar" ON storage.objects;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can update their own avatar" ON storage.objects;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can delete their own avatar" ON storage.objects;

-- 5. Create storage policies cho avatars bucket
CREATE POLICY "Users can upload their own avatar" ON storage.objects
  FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (
    bucket_id = 'avatars' AND 
    auth.uid()::text = (storage.foldername(name))[1]
  );

CREATE POLICY "Users can view their own avatar" ON storage.objects
  FOR SELECT USING (
    bucket_id = 'avatars' AND 
    auth.uid()::text = (storage.foldername(name))[1]
  );

CREATE POLICY "Users can update their own avatar" ON storage.objects
  FOR UPDATE USING (
    bucket_id = 'avatars' AND 
    auth.uid()::text = (storage.foldername(name))[1]
  );

CREATE POLICY "Users can delete their own avatar" ON storage.objects
  FOR DELETE USING (
    bucket_id = 'avatars' AND 
    auth.uid()::text = (storage.foldername(name))[1]
  );

-- 6. Kiểm tra kết quả
SELECT 
  schemaname,
  tablename,
  rowsecurity
FROM pg_tables 
WHERE tablename = 'profiles';

SELECT 
  policyname,
  tablename,
  permissive,
  roles,
  cmd
FROM pg_policies 
WHERE tablename = 'profiles';
